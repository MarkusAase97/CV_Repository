# MSc in mathematics

This folder contains my master thesis in mathematics at NTNU, under supervision with Jo Eidsvik.
I looked into how we can use statistical- and machine learning to predict persistent weak layers, based on previous weather and snow-condition data.
Although most of my thesis work went to processing data, instead of evolving new statistical learning approaches, I indepedently gave new insight in a field where data science is not frequently used.
For this I got a scholarship to present my work at the Norwegian Avalanche Conference at Oppdal, fall 2023 (https://www.skredkonferansen.no/programinnslag-2023/predicting-persistent-weak-layers-in-maritime-regions-in-norway-using-meteorologi)
