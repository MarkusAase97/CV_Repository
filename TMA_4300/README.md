# TMA4300 (NTNU, spring 2022) - Computer Intensive Statistical Methods

This folder includes our project submissions from a course in computational statistics in cooperation with Nora Røhnebæk Aasen.

Project 1: Sampling algorithms, Monte Carlo estimation, rejection and importance sampling.

Project 2: MCMC and INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation).

Project 3: Bootstrapping, the EM algorithm and permutation test.

The course ended with an oral exam, where we were tested in the mathematics behind the techniques from our projects. Here I recieved grade A (scale A-F).
