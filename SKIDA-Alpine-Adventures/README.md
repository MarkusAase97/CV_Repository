# Skida Alpine Adventures

I've been involved in a start-up, where I am the CTO of Skida Alpine Adventures. An app for skitouring enthusiasts, where I
get to use my skill as a mathematician to do machine learning, backend-coding and business development.

Additionally, I get to use my knowledge on avalanches, since I am a certified snow-avalanche instrutor through
Norsk Fjellsportsforum. I usually hold a few courses out in the mountains, each winter-season, to teach people, what to
look for and what do to/not to do - when it comes to skitouring.

This app, https://skida.app, is therefore a combination of academic interest and recreational.

Sourcecode will not be given publicly - but the app is available both on Android and AppStore :-)
